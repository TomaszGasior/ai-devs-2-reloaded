This repository contains my solutions for tasks from "AI Devs 2 Reloaded" course.

Requirements: PHP 8.3 and composer, installed locally.

Fill in `.env` file and run `composer install` before launching scripts.

Tasks are placed in `task` directory, each solution is separate PHP script
named after task name. To launch the solution run the task file directly:

```
php task/helloapi.php
```

Some tasks require prior setup. Read code and comments inside.
